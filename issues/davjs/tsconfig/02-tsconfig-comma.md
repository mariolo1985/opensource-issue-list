## What is this project? 

DAV (Decentralized Autonomous Vehicles) is a new foundation working to build an open-source infrastructure for autonomous vehicles (cars, drones, trucks, robots, and all the service providers around them) to communicate and transact with each other over blockchain.

As an organization that believes in building a large community of open-source contributors, we often create issues like this one to help people take their first few steps into the world of open source.

### dav-js

This repo contains the DAV JavaScript SDK. This SDK allows developers to build applications and servers that connect to the DAV network. For example, allowing a drone to find charging stations, or an autonomous car to ask for traffic data.

### The Issue

At the root level, we have a file named `tsconfig.json`. The JSON object contains trailing commas that makes it an invalid JSON object.

![Comma][comma]

Please remove the trailing commas highlighted in the screenshot above. 

> These highlights can be toggled with **ES Lint** by setting a rule for __comma-dangle__.
