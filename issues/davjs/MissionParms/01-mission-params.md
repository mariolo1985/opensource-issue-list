This issue is tagged :octocat: **first-timers-only**. It is only for people who have never contributed to open source before, and are looking for an easy way take their first steps.

Consider this your chance to dip your toe into the world of open-source, and get some bragging rights for writing code that makes drones fly, lets cars find charging stations, helps people and goods get from place to place, and more.

## What is this project? 

DAV (Decentralized Autonomous Vehicles) is a new foundation working to build an open-source infrastructure for autonomous vehicles (cars, drones, trucks, robots, and all the service providers around them) to communicate and transact with each other over blockchain.

As an organization that believes in building a large community of open-source contributors, we often create issues like this one to help people take their first few steps into the world of open source.

### dav-js

This repo contains the DAV JavaScript SDK. This SDK allows developers to build applications and servers that connect to the DAV network. For example, allowing a drone to find charging stations, or an autonomous car to ask for traffic data.

## How you can help

In order to foster a community that is welcoming for open source contributions, it is important for us to have good test coverage. And good tests are simple, readable tests.

Here is a good opportunity to simplify one of our tests.

### The Issue

In `src/ride-hailing/MissionParams.test.ts` we defined the following parameters at the beginning of the `describe()` block.

```javascript
const missionParams = new MissionParams({});

const serializedMissionParams: any = {
    ttl: undefined,
    protocol: 'ride_hailing',
    type: 'mission',
    price: undefined,
    vehicleId: undefined,
};
```

These parameters will need to accommodate new tests. 

Please update these parameters to be more dynamic by defining them to be mutable similar to `src/vessel-charging/MissionParams.test.ts`.

After making your changes, make sure the tests still pass by running `npm run jest`
